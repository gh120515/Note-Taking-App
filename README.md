# Note Taking App (powered by Express.js)

## Description

This JavaScript based application will allow the user to write and save notes.

Express.js is used as a basis for back-end operations, which is used to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This is the builder's first experience in building a full-stack app, incorporating the front-end with the back-end of a web app.
